## Explore Singapore Datasets with SG Data Analyst ðŸ¤–

Based on your query, SG Data Analyst will find the most relevant datasets from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/) and [data.gov.sg's API](https://developers.data.gov.sg/). 

Using Langchain's Pandas DataFrame Agent, SG Data Analyst will then perform exploratory data analysis on the datasets and gather insights to answer your query.
